### Arizona Community Foundation

I manage a Salesforce Org with just under 80 users for a non-profit, [Arizona Community Foundation](https://www.azfoundation.org).

## Developed Using

- [NPSP](https://github.com/SalesforceFoundation/NPSP) - nonprofitsuccesspack
- Lightning Web Components - A mix of custom LWC components I've written to both display data as well as facilitate business processes when Flows weren't the right choice.
- Apex - Outside of controllers for the LWCs, I try and use Flow whenever possible instead of Apex. I do have a few triggers and Invokable Actions.

### Managed/Unmanged Packages

- [S-Docs](https://www.sdocs.com/) - Generates PDF documents on platform. I can trigger these via Flows, Apex and through the UI using Custom Buttons.
- [DLRS](https://github.com/SFDO-Community/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries) - Declarative Lookup Rollup Summaries. When I need to do roll-ups on lookup relationships or using criteria that Salesforce's built in roll-ups just don't handle.
- [To A Finish Address Validation](https://appexchange.salesforce.com/appxListingDetail?listingId=a0N300000059eEUEAY) - Interface to SmartyStreets to do address validation. Great customer service.
- [Datatable](https://unofficialsf.com/datatable-lightning-web-component-for-flow-screens-2/) - Very good customizable datatable to use in Flows.
- [DocuSign](https://www.docusign.com/) - For signing documents.
